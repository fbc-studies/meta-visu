**REMEMBER TO RUN `npm run build` BEFORE PUBLISHING CHANGES!**

## Notes

- Styles won't work properly on IE11 because e.g. var() is used. Could be fixed if really needed.
- If IE11 support not needed, I should take a look at what other polyfills etc. can be removed.
- The few icons that are used, should be downloaded and served locally
- Polyfills/Babel bloat the code from about 10â€”15 kb to about 100 kb :(
